Why are forms so important in web development?
Forms are important because they allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage and clients can update the interface immediately.

When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
You should design a mock up to define the set of data you want to use. Determine the size . Ask for only data you need. Determine the elements you want to use.
List 5 form elements and explain their importance. 
The five elements are:
Form: represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information
Label:  represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
Input: used to create interactive controls for webbased forms in order to accept data from the user.
Textarea:  Represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text.
Button: Is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.

Introduction To Events.

How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
I would explain it in this way. A event tells the computer system being programmed what to do and how to react to my commands in the computer code.
When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
The two arguments you would provide are:
1.	 addEventListner is also known as event handler are the type of event such as click 
2.	The HTML event such as DOM,  the function we need to call went the event occurs

Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
EVENT Object and it is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information.
What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
The difference between event bubbling and event capturing are:
Event bubbling the browser captures the and handled inside element and then propagated to the outer elements.
Event capturing  the browser handles events targeted outside of the nested elements and then propagated to the inner elements.
